## Introduction

<!-- Enter a brief description of your research project below.  -->
<!--------This text can be formatted in Quarto Markdown.---------->
<!-- See https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html -->

**Rising Waters, Resilient Communities** is an emerging participatory research initiative in its initial phase, bringing together Dr. Tanesha Duval's methodological expertise from Palmetto Atlantic University with Dr. Mateo Nguyen's conceptual leadership from Redwood State University and supporting contributions from Dr. Riley Harper of Evergreen Valley University. The interdisciplinary team is currently building relationships with coastal South Carolina communities to document traditional ecological knowledge about sea level rise while establishing protocols for collaborative data collection with local residents. Though still in early development, the project has successfully launched community planning workshops and recruited citizen scientists who are beginning to monitor coastal changes, laying groundwork for the co-design of climate adaptation strategies that honor both scientific evidence and community priorities. As the project unfolds with support from The Research Foundation, the research team is focused on creating sustainable engagement mechanisms that will eventually translate into actionable resilience planning for these vulnerable coastal communities.

::: {.callout-note}
CEnTR\*IMPACT provides quantitative metrics specifically designed to effectively communicate the value of community-engaged scholarship within academic evaluation systems. These metrics enable scholars to demonstrate impact to review committees, research teams, and funders through compelling data-driven narratives that complement qualitative approaches. CEnTR\*IMPACT is grounded in the Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) methodology.

## Direct Indicators

Direct Indicators are status counts of information including the number of partner institutions;
the amount of time spent working together; the total number of attendees and participants at events and meetings; the total number of tools, documents, processes created to ensure fairness and accountability through the partnership; the total number of products---e.g., community-facing, scholar-facing---created; if engaged learning is a component of the project; and the number of agreed-to outcomes that have been met through the project.

### Results

```{r}
#| label: indicators-plot
#| fig-cap: "CEnTR-IMPACT Direct Indicators."
#| echo: false
#| out-width: "100%"

## Project Dynamics

Project Dynamics information provides insight into where the project started, how the project is being carried out, and where the project ended up so far. Providing indicators across the domains of contexts, processes, research, and outcomes, Project Dynamics provides a map for facilitating a more successful and fair partnership.

### Results

```{r}
#| label: dynamics-plot
#| fig-cap: "CEnTR-IMPACT Project Dynamics scores."
#| echo: false
#| out-width: "75%"

# Display the plot
knitr::include_graphics(
  glue::glue("plots/{project_name} - dynamics_plot - {report_date}.png")

## Project Alignment

Project Alignment illuminates the degree to which community partners and university researchers are aligned on the following areas: Goals, Values, Roles, Resources, Activities, Empowerment,
Outputs, and Outcomes. Project Alignment is determined through a common survey provided to researchers and community partners.

### Results

```{r}
#| label: alignment-plot
#| fig-cap: "Project Alignment visualization."
#| echo: false
#| out-width: "100%"
```

The Alignment Score ($S_a$) is `r alignment_score`.

`r knitr::include_graphics(glue::glue("plots/{project_name} - alignment_plot - {report_date}.png"))`

`r kable(alignment_df)`

## Project Cascade Effects

Cascade Effects is a measure of the *potential* for community-engaged research impacts to spread to people based on the *structure* of an estimated model of the project's social network across three degrees. The first degree (1°) is comprised of the project staff and community participants directly involved in the project, and the second (2°) and third (3°) degrees are spread outwardly from there.

### Results

```{r}
#| label: cascade-plot
#| fig-cap: "Project Cascade Effects visualization."
#| echo: false
#| out-width: "75%"

# This would call your cascade effects visualization function
# create_cascade_plots(project_name, snapshot_date, report_date, colors)
knitr::include_graphics(
  glue::glue(
    "plots/{project_name} - cascade_effects_plot - {report_date}.png"
    ))
```


```{r}
#| echo: false

cascade_df |>
  kable() |>
  kable_styling(
    bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"),
    stripe_color = "#F2ECD7"
  )
