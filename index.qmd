## Introduction

This is the CEnTR-IMPACT report for `r project_name` generated on `r report_date`.

**CEnTR\*IMPACT** is a set of quantitative metrics grounded in Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) methodology.

<!-- See https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html -->



<!-- Enter a brief description of your research project above.  -->

```{r}
#| label: dashboard-plot
#| fig-cap: "CEnTR-IMPACT scores."
#| echo: false
#| out-width: "100%"

# Display the plot
knitr::include_graphics(
  glue::glue("plots/{project_name} - dashboard_plot - {report_date}.png")
 )

```

## Direct Indicators

Direct Indicators are status counts of information including the number of partner instituations;
the amount of time spent working together; the total number of attendees and participants at events and meetings; the total number of tools, documents, processes created to ensure fairness and accountability through the partnership; the total number of products---e.g., community-facing, scholar-facing---created; if engaged learning is a component of the project; and the number of agreed-to outcomes that have been met through the project.

### Results

```{r}
#| label: indicators-plot
#| fig-cap: "CEnTR-IMPACT Direct Indicators."
#| echo: false
#| out-width: "100%"

# Display the plot
knitr::include_graphics(
  glue::glue("plots/{project_name} - indicators_plot - {report_date}.png")
)
```

### Analysis

## Project Dynamics

Project Dynamics information provides insight into where the project started, how the project is being carried out, and where the project ended up so far. Providing indicators across the domains of contexts, processes, research, and outcomes, Project Dynamics provides a map for facilitating a more successful and fair partnership.

### Results

```{r}
#| label: dynamics-plot
#| fig-cap: "CEnTR-IMPACT Project Dynamics scores."
#| echo: false
#| out-width: "75%"

# Display the plot
knitr::include_graphics(
  glue::glue("plots/{project_name} - dynamics_plot - {report_date}.png")
)
```

## Project Alignment

Project Alignment illuminates the degree to which community partners and university researchers are aligned on the following areas: Goals, Values, Roles, Resources, Activities, Empowerment,
Outputs, and Outcomes. Project Alignment is determined through a common survey provided to researchers and community partners.

### Results

```{r}
#| label: alignment-plot
#| fig-cap: "Project Alignment visualization."
#| echo: false
#| out-width: "100%"
```

The Alignment Score ($S_a$) is `r alignment_score`.

`r knitr::include_graphics(glue::glue("plots/{project_name} - alignment_plot - {report_date}.png"))`

`r kable(alignment_df)`

## Project Cascade Effects

Cascade Effects is a measure of the *potential* for community-engaged research impacts to spread to people based on the *structure* of an estimated model of the project's social network across three degrees. The first degree (1°) is comprised of the project staff and community participants directly involved in the project, and the second (2°) and third (3°) degrees are spread outwardly from there.

### Results

```{r}
#| label: cascade-plot
#| fig-cap: "Project Cascade Effects visualization."
#| echo: false
#| out-width: "75%"

# This would call your cascade effects visualization function
# create_cascade_plots(project_name, snapshot_date, report_date, colors)
knitr::include_graphics(
  glue::glue(
    "plots/{project_name} - cascade_effects_plot - {report_date}.png"
    ))
```

## Equations

The following are equations utilized to calculate the intermediate and final scores.

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Geometric Mean ($\text{GM}$)

$$ \text{GM} = \left(\prod_{j=1}^{n} M_j\right)^{\frac{1}{n}} $$
where $s_i$ is the individual domain score.

### LaTeX

```latex
s_i = \left(\prod_{j=1}^{n} M_j\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
```

### R

```r
library(psych)
geometric_mean <- geometric.mean(data_frame$vector)
```

:::

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Gini Index Complement ($G_{\text{c}}$)

$$ G_{\text{c}} = 1 - \left( \frac{1}{2n^2\mu} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} | y_i - y_j | \right) $$
Where: $n$ is the number of domains or degrees, $y_i$ and $y_j$ are domain or degree scores, 
and $\mu$ is the mean domain or degree score.

### LaTeX

```latex
G' = 1 - \left( \frac{1}{2n^2\mu} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} | y_i - y_j | \right)
```

### R

```r
library(psych)
geometric_mean <- geometric.mean(data_frame$vector)
```
