The interdisciplinary team is currently building relationships with coastal South Carolina communities to document traditional ecological knowledge about sea level rise while establishing protocols for collaborative data collection with local residents. Though still in early development, the project has successfully launched community planning workshops and recruited citizen scientists who are beginning to monitor coastal changes, laying groundwork for the co-design of climate adaptation strategies that honor both scientific evidence and community priorities. As the project unfolds with support from The Research Foundation, the research team is focused on creating sustainable engagement mechanisms that will eventually translate into actionable resilience planning for these vulnerable coastal communities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCEnTR-IMPACT scores.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nCEnTR*IMPACT provides quantitative metrics specifically designed to effectively communicate the value of community-engaged scholarship within academic evaluation systems.
