## What is CEnTR\*IMPACT?

CEnTR\*IMPACT is an ensemble-based, values-driven system of metrics for evaluating community-engaged research. It provides scores that reflect:

- **Alignment** between researchers and community partners
- **Project Dynamics** across process, learning, and outcome categories
- **Cascade Effects** as information spreads through networks
- **Direct Indicators** of activity and output
